                        Student Robotics is an exciting annual competition that
                        challenges teams of 16–18 year-olds to build fully
                        autonomous robots. Participating teams must design,
                        build and test their robots, ready to compete against
                        other teams.
                    </p>
                    <!-- TODO: Add a picture of a robot. -->
                    <p>
                        The organisation started out as an idea from a few
                        students at the
                        <a href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/">University of
                        Southampton</a> and since then, it has grown massively
                        and continues to atttract students and schools from
                        across the UK and Germany.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Last year, we ran our competition at
                        <a href="http://www.newburyracecourse.co.uk/">Newbury
                        Racecourse</a> and it was a great success! We had over
                        fifty teams taking part and a large number of
                        volunteers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All of what we achieve as an organsation is lead by
                        our team of hard working volunteers. The most important
                        role as an volunteer is to make sure the teams have a
                        robot to compete with each year and get them excited
                        about robotics and engineering. As a volunteer, you
                        will be assigned a school and visit them as often as
                        possible (usually on a weekly basis) to talk with the
                        team and make sure everything is going to plan. As well
                        as mentoring competitors, we also have volunteers who
                        get involved in the organisation of Student Robotics:
                        everything from writing software, designing hardware,
                        talking to sponsors and much more is open to you

                    <p>
                        The idea of mentoring can be a little scary at first,
                        but we aim to make you as comfortable as possible in
                        your new role.

                            I expected it to be more like teaching, but it was
                            more about supporting the teams, I think that’s a
                            good idea because it doesn’t waste their time.

                    <p>
                        For your first few mentoring sessions, we always make
                        sure that new volunteers are sent out with an
                        experienced mentor, known as a tutor. The idea behind
                        this is to let you watch how your tutor deals with
                        situations and also let you ask them questions about
                        mentoring in general. Your tutor will also help you
                        to communicate with the school to agree meeting times
                        and other details.
