                        Student Robotics is an exciting annual competition that
                        challenges teams of 16–18 year-olds to build fully
                        autonomous robots. Participating teams must design,
                        build and test their robots, ready to compete against
                        other teams.
                    </p>
                    <!-- TODO: Add a picture of a robot. -->
                    <p>
                        The organisation started out as an idea from a few
                        students at the
                        <a href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/">University of
                        Southampton</a> and since then, it has grown massively
                        and continues to atttract students and schools from
                        across the UK and Germany.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Last year, we ran our competition at
                        <a href="http://www.newburyracecourse.co.uk/">Newbury
                        Racecourse</a> and it was a great success! We had over
                        fifty teams taking part and a large number of
                        volunteers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All of what we achieve as an organsation is lead by
                        our team of hard working volunteers. The most important
                        role as an volunteer is to make sure the teams have a
                        robot to compete with each year and get them excited
                        about robotics and engineering. As a volunteer, you
                        will be assigned a school and visit them as often as
                        possible (usually on a weekly basis) to talk with the
                        team and make sure everything is going to plan. As well
                        as mentoring competitors, we also have volunteers who
                        get involved in the organisation of Student Robotics:
                        everything from writing software, designing hardware,
                        talking to sponsors and much more is open to you.

                    <p>
                        The idea of mentoring can be a little scary at first,
                        but we aim to make you as comfortable as possible in
                        your new role.

                        <p>
                            I expected it to be more like teaching, but it was
                            more about supporting the teams, I think that’s a
                            good idea because it doesn’t waste their time.
                            — <em>A new volunteer after first time
                            mentoring</em>

                    <p>
                        For your first few mentoring sessions, we always make
                        sure that new volunteers are sent out with an
                        experienced mentor, known as a tutor. The idea behind
                        this is to let you watch how your tutor deals with
                        situations and also let you ask them questions about
                        mentoring in general. Your tutor will also help you
                        to communicate with the school to agree meeting times
                        and other details.

                <h1>Flying solo</h1>
                <section class="content">
                    <p>
                        After you’ve been mentoring with your tutor for a few
                        weeks, it’s time to fly the nest!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Starting on a more serious note, you should be aware
                        that in the appendix, you will find an incident
                        flow-chart that you can use if you have to while
                        mentoring a school.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before you go mentoring, you must have a DBS check to
                        make sure that you are able and suitable to work with
                        children.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many mentors are worried at first that they won't be
                        very helpful as they don’t know all the answers…
                        don’t be! The aim of the mentor is about helping teams
                        find out the answers on their own. There is no need for
                        you to memorise the rulebook or anything like that; you
                        can look up queries <strong>with</strong> the
                        competitors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s important to let competitors figure out problems
                        on their own, it’s not your job to fix everything. You
                        should ask leading questions about how their robot is
                        going and nudge them in the right diretion. For
                        example, you can ask questions like “If you do
                        <em>that</em>, what do you think will happen in
                        <em>this</em> situation?”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s okay to let the competitors do crazy things, but
                        you need to make sure they do so safely. Health &amp;
                        Safety is a very important aspect of Student Robotics,
                        since we are letting young adults play with high-tech
                        electronic equipment with some pretty powerful
                        battiers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You should encourage the team to prototype, rather than
                        discuss, ideas. Get them to split the build into
                        small sub-goals and then attempt to achieve each of
                        those goals each time they meet. For example, start
                        wit a robot which moves in a straight line, then one
                        that turns towards markers and then one that drives
                        towards markers, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Get your teams to post on the forums as much as
                        possible. This helps them to get to know other teams
                        and volunteers better, and even allows rival teams to
                        help each other to build amazing robots.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Make sure that the competitors are aware of the
                        simulator that we provide them. It’s inevitable that
                        teams will leave the programming until the end—when
                        the robot is built—however, with the simulator they can
                        get started on that right away.

                <h1>Debugging</h1>
                <section class="content">
                    <p>
                        Debugging is the methodical process of solving problems
                        and removing bugs from software or hardware.
                        Competitors will spend the majority of their time
                        debugging their robots and it’s your job to help them
                        through this process, but certainly not to know all the
                        answers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An important step in helping your team to debug is to
                        let them tell you what they’re doing, and often, this
                        works as an excellent strategy to find bugs. As the
                        competitors explain what’s going on, they will end up
                        thinking about it and spot any mistakes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can get your team to build a minimal set up with
                        only the required boards and peripherals plugged in to
                        see if that makes a difference. If there is a specific
                        problem with any of their boards, you should get in
                        touch with another volunteer <!-- Who? --> to sort that
                        out.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We provide a <a href="https://www.studentrobotics.org/docs/troubleshooting/">
                        troubleshooting section</a> in our documentation that
                        is ready for competitors to use, pointing them towards
                        this page is an excellent first step. Remember, mentors
                        do not need to immediately know the answers. Helping
                        competitors to find the answers by looking through our
                        documentation is more useful to both the competitors
                        and the mentor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You should encourage your team to post any questions
                        on the
                        <a href="https://www.studentrobotics.org/forum/">
                        Forums</a>. This allows teams to communicate with other
                        teams and volunteers from across the whole of Student
                        Robotics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, it’s okay if you are unable to solve the
                        problem yourself. There are plenty of other volunteers
                        who would be more than happy to diagnose the problem
                        and help you find a solution.

                        The best way of keeping up to date is by subscibing to
                        the news mailing list. On this list, you will find
                        newsletters, event announcements and other news.

                    <p>
                        Every fortnight, a newsletter is sent out, creatively
                        named the SR(A)WN—Student Robotics Almost Weekly
                        Newsletter. It contains information on what’s been
                        happening over the past two weeks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Any events that are happening in your local branch will
                        be announced on the mailing list a few days beforehand.
                        This way you know exactly what’s going on, and you can
                        choose to join in on activites you will find
                        interesting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is important to note that the mailing list can be
                        overwhelming, especially for a new volunteer. We’re
                        currently working on getting a separate mailing list
                        which is used only to post about new events and no
                        discussion.

                            locations and they require a large amount of
                            coordination.

                        Generally, students who run the various branches will
                        have weekly meetings (otherwise known as doings) which
                        are a way of getting stuff done with lots of other
                        volunteers. The reason they're known as doings instead
                        of meetings is because a doing is where things get
                        done, not just discussed.

                        To help manage everything that needs to be done, we
                        have a <a href="https://www.studentrobotics.org/trac/">
                        project management</a> system running, which is powered
                        by <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a>. We use
                        the ticket facility for everything from recording if
                        teams have broken equipment to organising who needs to
                        do what at the competition.

                    <p>
                        If you’re familiar with the command line, we also have
                        a number of useful
                        <a href="http://srtools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">
                        tools</a> for working with our budget system, our
                        inventory system and a few other miscellaneous things.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We also have a few mailing lists on
                        <a href="https://groups.google.com">Google Groups</a>
                        that you may wish to subscribe to.

                    <p>
                        It’s worth noting that the mailing lists can be a
                        little overwheling at first, and they’re not
                        necessarily useful to all volunteers.
