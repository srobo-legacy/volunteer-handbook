        <h1>What is Student Robotics?</h1>
        <section class="content">
          <p>
            Student Robotics is an exciting annual competition that challenges
            teams of 16–18 year-olds to build fully autonomous robots.
            Participating teams must design, build, and test their robots,
            ready to compete against other teams.
          </p>
          <!-- TODO: Add a picture of a robot. -->
          <p>
            The organisation started out as an idea from a few students at the
            <a href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/">University of
            Southampton</a>. Since then it has grown massively, and continues
            to attract students and schools from across the UK, France, and
            Germany.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of what we achieve as an organisation is lead by our team of
            hard working volunteers. Volunteers have a wide range of different
            roles: mentoring competitors, writing software, solving engineering
            challenges, organising large events, public speaking, and many more
            are open to you. The most important role for our volunteers is
            mentoring; making sure that teams have a robot to compete with each
            year and getting them excited about robotics and engineering. As a
            mentor, you will be assigned a school and visit it as often as
            possible (usually on a weekly basis) to talk with the team and make
            sure everything is going to plan.

        <h1>Your first mentoring session</h1>
        <section class="content">
          <p>
            The idea of mentoring can be a little scary at first, but we aim to
            make you as comfortable as possible in your new role.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              I expected it to be more like teaching, but it was more about
              supporting the teams, I think that’s a good idea because it
              doesn’t waste their time. — <em>A new volunteer after first time
              mentoring</em>

          </blockquote>
          <p>
            For your first few mentoring sessions, we always make sure that new
            volunteers are sent out with an experienced mentor as a tutor. The
            idea behind this is to let you watch how your tutor deals with
            situations and also let you ask them questions about mentoring in
            general. Your tutor will also help you to communicate with the
            school to agree meeting times and other details.

        <h1>Flying solo</h1>
        <section class="content">
          <p>
            After you’ve been mentoring with your tutor for a few weeks, it’s
            time to fly the nest!
          </p>
          <p>
            Starting on a more serious note, you should be aware that in the
            appendix, you will find an incident flow-chart, that you can use
            if you have to while mentoring a school.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before you go mentoring, you must have a DBS check to make sure
            that you are able and suitable to work with children.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many mentors are worried at first that they won't be very helpful
            as they don’t know all the answers… don’t be! The aim of the mentor
            is about helping teams find out the answers on their own. There is
            no need for you to memorise the rulebook or anything like that; you
            can look up queries <strong>with</strong> the competitors.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s important to let competitors figure out problems on their own;
            it’s not your job to fix everything. You should ask leading
            questions about how the build is going and nudge them in the right
            direction. For example, you can ask questions like “If you do that,
            what do you think will happen in <em>this</em> situation?”.
          </p>
          <p>
            You should encourage the team to prototype, rather than discuss,
            ideas. Get them to split the build into small sub-goals and then
            attempt to achieve each of those goals one at a time. For example,
            start by getting the team to have the kit move a motor in a
            contolled manner and then get a moving chassis. Perhaps then start
            looking at getting a robot which moves in a straight line, then one
            that turns towards markers and then one that drives towards
            markers, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Encourage your teams to use the forums as much as possible. This
            helps them to get to know other teams and our volunteers better,
            and even allows rival teams to help each other to build better
            robots.
          </p>
          <p>
            As well as helping them code in
            <a href="https://www.studentrobotics.org/docs/IDE/">our online
            <abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr></a>,
            make sure that the competitors are aware of the simulator that we
            provide them. It’s inevitable that teams will leave the programming
            until the end—when the robot is built—however, with
            <a href="https://www.studentrobotics.org/docs/programming/simulator">
            the simulator</a> they can get started on that right away.

        <h1>Debugging</h1>
        <section class="content">
          <p>
            Debugging is the methodical process of solving problems and
            removing bugs from software or hardware. Competitors will spend the
            majority of their time debugging their robots and it’s your job to
            help them through this process, although certainly not to know all
            the answers.
          </p>
          <p>
            An important step in helping your team to debug is to let them tell
            you what they’re doing, and regularly. This works as an excellent
            strategy to find bugs. As the competitors explain what’s going on,
            they will end up thinking about it and spot any mistakes.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the team are experencing problems with their robot, you could
            get them to build a minimal set up with only the required boards
            and peripherals plugged in to see if that makes a difference. If
            there is a specific problem with any of their boards, you should
            get in touch with another volunteer to sort that out.
          </p>
          <p>
            We provide a
            <a href="https://www.studentrobotics.org/docs/troubleshooting/">troubleshooting</a>
            section in our documentation that is ready for competitors to use.
            Pointing them towards this page is an excellent first step.
            Remember, mentors do not need to immediately know the answers.
            Helping competitors to find the answers by looking through our
            documentation is more useful to both the competitors and the
            mentor.
          </p>
          <p>
            You should encourage your team to post any questions on the
            <a href="https://www.studentrobotics.org/forum/">forums</a>.
            This allows teams to communicate with other teams and volunteers
            from across the whole of Student Robotics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, it’s okay if you are unable to solve the problem yourself.
            There are plenty of other volunteers who would be more than happy
            to diagnose the problem and help you find a solution.

        <h1>Keeping up to date</h1>
        <section class="content">
          <p>
            The best way of keeping up to date is by subscribing to the mailing
            list. On this list, you will find newsletters, event announcements
            and other news.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every fortnight, a newsletter is sent out, named SR(A)WN—Student
            Robotics (Almost) Weekly Newsletter. It contains information on
            what’s been happening over the past two weeks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any events that are happening near you will be announced on the
            mailing list a few days beforehand. This way you know exactly
            what’s going on, and you can choose to join in with activities you
            find interesting.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important to note that the mailing list can be overwhelming,
            especially for a new volunteer. We’re currently working on getting
            a separate mailing list which is used only to post about new events
            and no discussion.

        <h1>Where does it go from here?</h1>
        <section class="content">
          <p>
            As well as mentoring, we offer a large range of other activities
            that volunteers might want to get involved in—after all, we do have
            a competition to run!
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              For <em>software developers</em>, we have a large number of
              <a href="https://studentrobotics.org/cgit">code repositories</a>
              that you might be interested in getting stuck into and
              contributing your own ideas and concepts. We also have a
              <a href="https://www.studentrobotics.org/gerrit/">code review</a>
              platform powered by
              <a href="https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/">Gerrit</a> that all
              volunteers have the ability to submit their feedback on.
            </li>
            <li>
              For <em>electronics people</em>, we develop all our custom boards
              in-house and would welcome any sort of input on how we could
              improve them for future kits.
            </li>
            <li>
              Moving away from software and hardware, we always need people who
              would be interested in helping to manage our events and organise
              people. Since the organisation has grown to span many parts of
              the country, we often run parallel events at different locations
              and they require a large amount of coordination.
            </li>
            <li>
              Communication is an important part of what we do, from
              <a href="https://www.studentrobotics.org/docs/">writing
              documentation</a> to
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRgzY5sUYQ8">filming and
              editing videos</a>.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Generally, students who run the various branches will have weekly
            meetings (otherwise known as doings) which are a way of getting
            stuff done with lots of other volunteers. The reason they're known
            as doings instead of meetings is because a doing is where things
            get done, not just discussed.
          </p>
          <p>
            To help manage everything that needs to be done, we have a
            <a href="https://www.studentrobotics.org/trac/">project
            management</a> system running, which is powered by
            <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a>. We use the ticket
            facility for everything from recording if teams have broken
            equipment to organising who needs to do what at the competition.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’re familiar with the command line, we also havea number of
            useful <a href="http://srtools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">tools</a>
            for working with our budget system, our inventory system and a few
            other miscellaneous things.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also have a few mailing lists on
            <a href="https://groups.google.com">Google Groups</a> that you may
            wish to subscribe to.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/srobo">General Happenings</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/srobo-devel">Development Discussions</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/srobo-game">Game Decisions and Proposals</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            It’s worth noting that the mailing lists can be a little
            overwhelming at first, and they’re not necessarily useful to all
            volunteers.
